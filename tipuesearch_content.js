Picrasidines G, S, and T feature an indolotetrahydroquinolizinium ( ITHQ ) skeleton, while picrasidine R possesses a 1,4-diketone linker between two β-carboline fragments. The synthesis of ITHQ -type bis-β-carboline alkaloids could be directly achieved by a late-stage regio-selective aza-[4 + 2] cycloaddition of vinyl β-carboline alkaloids, suggesting that this remarkable aza-[4 + 2] cycloaddition might be involved in the biosynthetic pathway. Computational studies revealed that such aza-[4 + 2] cycloaddition is a stepwise process and explained the unique regioselectivity (ΔΔ G = 3.77 kcal mol −1 ). Moreover, the successful application of iridium-catalyzed C–H borylation on β-carboline substrates enabled the site-selective C-8 functionalization for efficient synthesis and structural diversification of this family of natural products. Finally, concise synthesis of picrasidine R by the thiazolium-catalyzed Stetter reaction was also accomplished.
